1,"Odd and even trials listed in order of presentation separately for each"

1,"even trials for each trial-type within each block (i.e., 2 blocks = 16"
1,"means; 4 blocks = 32 means; 6 blocks = 48 means.) Difference scores* can"

1,"for each trial type for both odd and even trials (i.e., 2 blocks = 8"

1,"scores (one from odd trials and the other from even trials) for the same"
1,"trial-types and same pairs of test blocks. These pairs of difference"
1,"scores may be correlated using a Spearman-Brown correction (2 Blocks = 4"

1,"each trial type for each pair of test blocks; 6 Blocks = 12 correlations,"

1,"Odd and even trials listed in order of presentation separately for each"
1,"trial-type and test block. This facilitates calculation of split-half"
1,"reliability. First, calculate separate mean latencies for odd and then"
1,"even trials for each trial-type within each block (i.e., 2 blocks = 16"
1,"means; 4 blocks = 32 means; 6 blocks = 48 means.) Difference scores* can"
1,"then be calculated for each pair of consistent and inconsistent blocks"
1,"for each trial type for both odd and even trials (i.e., 2 blocks = 8"
1,"difference scores; 4 blocks = 16 difference scores; 6 blocks = 24"
1,"difference scores). Each participant thus provides pairs of difference"
1,"scores (one from odd trials and the other from even trials) for the same"
1,"trial-types and same pairs of test blocks. These pairs of difference"
1,"scores may be correlated using a Spearman-Brown correction (2 Blocks = 4"
1,"correlations, one for each trial=type; 4 Blocks = 8 correlations, one for"
1,"each trial type for each pair of test blocks; 6 Blocks = 12 correlations,"
1,"one for each trial-type for each pair of test blocks). Each correlation"
1,"thus provides a split-half reliability measure for a particular"
1,"trial-type for each pair of test blocks."
1,""
1,"*The difference scores may be calculated from 300-3000 adjusted latencies"
1,"or by calculating separate D measures for odd and even trials in the same"
1,"way that single D scores were calculated above for the odd and even trials"
1,"combined."
